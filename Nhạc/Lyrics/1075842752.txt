It's me!

We're Animatronics who play music in the day



but at night we come to play
And we're gonna fand a way to you
Now if you listen to the message on the phone
They think we're left in free roam
They left you here all alone!

In us robots
souls are traped inside
all we want is revenge
and we know were you hide

Through these rooms
we're gonna get to you
So I bet that you can not stay alive

It's me!

Can you survive these nights?
Dead or alive
Five Nights at Freddy's
These nights are passing by
Can you survive?
Five Nights at Freddy's

Five Nights at Freddy's
Come if you are ready
Five Five Five Five Nights at Freddys
Five Five Five Five Nights at Freddys
Five Nights at Freddy's
Come if you are ready
Five Five Five Five Nights at Freddys
Five Five Five Five Nights-
It's me!

Are we a bunny and a chicken and a fox in here
is there inly us to fear?
'Cuz it doesen't seem quite clear to you
We used to
