I got no time, 
I got no time to live,
I got no time to live, and I can't say good bye,
And I'm regretting having memories
Of my friends who they used to be
Beside me before they left me to die.

And I know this is,
I know this is the truth,
Cause I've been staring at my death so many times,
These scary monsters roaming in the halls,
I wish I could just block the doors
and stay in bed until the clock will chime

Chorus:
So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'till dawn,
I got this headache and my life's on the line
I felt like I won, but I wasn't done,
The nightmare repeats itself every time

Got to keep my calm, and carry on
stay awake until the sun will shine
But I'm not so strong, and they're not gone
They're still out there to take what's left of mine

I have this urge
I have this urge to kill
I have this urge to kill and show that I'm alive
I'm getting sick from these apologies
From people with priorities
That their life matters so much more than mine

But I'm stuttering
I'm stuttering again
No will listen and no one will understand,
Because I'm crying as much as I speak
Cause no one likes me when I shriek
want to go back to when it all began
