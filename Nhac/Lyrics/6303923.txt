Bài hát : Old Doll - Aya Drevis Hey, can you hear me? I called out your name Where are you from? What is it that's brought you here? Why wont you answer me? I swear to play nice Isn't this fun? This game of hide-and-seek I only wanted to hear your voice Skin that's warm Eyes that cry I only wanted to see your smile Feel your touch It's been a while Long, long ago, I was a girl just like you Father loved me, kept me safe and beautiful Oh how I'd love to dance around just once more But these cold legs, don't move anymore.
