A Symphony of Justite

When i was a child i has nobody in this world
I was left alone just a sweet little quiet girl
When i tried to speak words i wanted to say were gone
"Someone take me soon, i've been waiting for far too long"
Years went by, and still no one came
Then one day everything in my life changed 
I was home and i learned to play the chords true and strong
Now i have found where i belong
Find your strength in the music ringing out to set the stage
Fly on wings of celerity swift and true
Perservere through the battle though you may be wearing thin
Summoner, know that i believe in you.

I will keep you safe feel my symphony all around
Listen to my hymn and our victory will resound
From my mind to yours we will win this before too long
A sublime duet is resonating through my song 
We must fight for that in which we believe
As the harmonies interweave
Into one bright crescendo in the dance we call "life"
Caroing our  will to end the strife
And the stars play a melody that echoes through and through
Can you hear all the songs that Runeterra sings??
We will find our enlightenment inside the serenade
Place your trust in the Maven of the Strings
Find your strength in the music ringing our to set the stage
Fly on wings of celerity swift and true
Perservere through the battle though you may be wearing thin
Summoner, know that i believe in you.
